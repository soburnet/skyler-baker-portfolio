# Storyboard & Research 
## Please View Storyboard Below

I am still making progress within my storyboard thus far. I have been utilizing DataWrapper and my own sketches, but do plan to incorporate Tableau to elevate the look of my visualizations. There is a general outline that higlights the following:

Introduction: Explains the frequency in which young adults use social media.
<br/>
Climax: Explains the negative effects of social media on those young adults.
<br/>
Resolution: Explains the ways in which young adults can reduce social media use and how limiting time on social media reduces its negative effects. There is also mention of next generations, younger children and babies, who are already seeing high frequency in media usage. This is intended as this audience may have younger children, so that awareness for reducing usage among them is provided.

# User Research

## Target Audience 
As mentioned above, my target audience are young adults. Specifically, ages 18 to 29. Originally, it was 16 to 29, but I felt I needed to condense this in order to be more specific. My approach is to include photos of young adults, talk about how sleep deprivation (an effect of social media) leads to poor academic performance, which may be relevant to college students, and other relevant topics such as this. 

## Interview Script 

My goal is to ensure the story itself and the intended audience is clear. Therefore, I will ask the interviewees very straightforward questions in order to gather if this is the case and how I can improve. I also would like to make sure my graphs align with the story I am trying to tell and if they are misleading or confusing in any way. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Clear Story     |     Can you please describe what story you think this is telling?             |
|  Clear Audience    |      Who do you think the intended audience is for this?             |
|  Graphs Align with General Story    |  Do you think these graphs emphasize and add to key storytelling points?  |


## Interview Findings 

### Interviewee Characteristics 
Interviewee 1: Heinz Student, Ohio, Late 20s 
<br/>
Interviewee 2: Heinz Student, Pennsylvania, Early 30s 
<br/>
Interviewee 3: Early-Career Professional, Texas, Late 20s 
<br/>
| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you please describe what story you think this is telling? | How young adults are addicted to their phones. | How disruptive social media addiction is | How social media is bad for you. | 
| Who do you think the intended audeince is for this?  | Young Adults | Early to Late 20s | Late Teens to Early 30s |
| Do you think these graphs emphasize and add to key storytelling points? | Yes, the graphs do a nice job of conveying the story. | The title of the last graph in the last section is a little confusing. | Yes, I think there are a lot of pie charts though, which is a little distracting.|


# Identified Changes for Part III

| Research Synthesis                       | Anticipated Changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perceived as Social Media Being "Bad" | I will definitely lean into this more by making colors within the graphs more associated with "negative feelings." My intention is to convey that social media has negative effects, so the feeling is there. I can emphasize it more.|
| Audience is within the Young Adult Range | This is good. However, there was a wider range than I anticipated being conveyed. My plan was already to condense this, but I may condense it even more to 18 to Late 20s. |
| Confusing Title of Last Graph |  I plan to simplify the title of the graph that the interviewee was referring to in order to make it more clear and direct. |
| Number of Pie Charts |  I will find other ways to tell the same story with my current data visualizations. Of course, I will be adding more. As I add more and revise, I will try to find ways to be more creative and clever with my visualizations instead of sticking to pie charts. |

Overall, I feel as though I am on the right track. As I condense the age range referenced within the story, I feel it will be more direct in who it is for. There are many things that I plan to add and clean up. In general, I feel I can be more creative in how I visualize my data and more straightforward as well. The story itself is generally clear, but in order to make it apparent of why the story is saying social media is "bad," I will look for ways to more strongly introduce its negative affects.
