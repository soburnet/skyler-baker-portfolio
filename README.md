# Data Visualization Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for *Telling Stories with Data* at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. Please note that the work shown on this website are results of assignments from this course. 

# About Me 
Hi! My name is Skyler Baker. I am a second year Master of Arts Management candidate with a focus in the performing arts. My career interests are geared towards operations, programming, or the production side of the arts. I have a Bachelor's in Theatre Arts. I really am a artist at heart, but am passionate about contributing to a sustainable future for arts organizations.

I am currently hoping to develop skills in data visualization design to promote the use of data within arts organizations, so more data-driven strategies can be incorporated. I believe data will be vital to ensuring the sustainability of arts organizations, so an understanding of how to utilize data visualizations to tell stories is equally as critical for arts leaders to be able to convey key information from the data. I look forward to gaining these skills to better serve the arts industry. 

# What I Hope to Learn 
There are several things I am eager to learn from this course. Please read the following. 

1. How to Effectively Utilize Color in Data Visualizations 
2. How Data Visualizations can Strengthen Key Points & Emphasize a Story  
3. How to Design a Variety of Graphs and Data Visualizations

## Plans After Graduation 
Once I graduate, I plan to seek a job in either a remote arts service organization or an in-person theatre company in marketing, programming, or operations. I also plan to revisit my love for theatre by joining productions as a director, stage manager, or even performer.
