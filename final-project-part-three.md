# The Final Data Story
My Data Story Can Be Found Here: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-hidden-truths-of-how-social-media-effects-the-well-being-of-young-adults/index.html 

# Changes Made Since Part II 
Since Part II, I have made tremendous progress on my storyboard. Ultimately, I ended up using Data Wrapper for all of my visualizations. I originally had made a few of my own sketches, but for aesthetic purposes, I wanted consistency within the look of my visualizations. 

The narrative within my story remained the same, with a few additional tweaks such as defining the age group. The climax, explaining potential negative effects of social media addiction, as well as the resolution, which includes the call to action that urges young adults to reduce their time on social media, also remained the same. Something I did add within the call to action was to be aware of this issue for future generations, because this is the age group that is most likely to start families within the next decade or so. This made the piece about babies already having access to iPads a little more relevant.   

While making these adjustments, I did reference my original interviewees again to ask if the changes that were being made reflected what they were imagining when they gave me the feedback. Notably, all of my interviewees were also in this age group, which gave me insight into how relevant the topic was to them. 

## The Audience 
This decision to identify the audience as those within the age group of 18 to 25 was to narrow down how social media may effect them specifically, since there is a higher percentage frequent users of social media within this group. Visually, I worked to appeal to this audeince by including photos of young adults and included a blurb on how sleep deprivation, an effect of social media, leads to poor academic performance, which may be relevant to college students within this age group, and other relevant topics such as this. 

## Final Design Decisions 
My visualizations are fairly different from my submission in Part II, with changes in color to better align with the intention of how I wanted the audience to feel as well as an aesthetic I was trying to create. For instance, the first few visualizations are blue to establish a neutral feel within the introduction and then during the climax, the visualizations become red or warmer colors. The call to action also now reflects two elements: options for reducing risks of the negative effects of social media, which are in green, and then the call to be aware and informed for future generations which is in red again. Overall, I decided to keep the visualizations simple because this class has taught me that simplicity is better and that less is more. I also did slightly reduce the amount of pie charts within my story and played with other types of visualizations.

# Final Thoughts
This project went very well. By keeping it simple and thoroughly planning my story, I was able to accomplish my work in a reasonable amount of time. I do wish I had a change to revisit the college aspect that may be common within this age group and lean more into how social media effects academic performance. Another thing I wish I would have considered earlier is which platforms have induce more negative side effects than others, in other words, a comparison. However, I was still excited to tell a story that I feel very strongly about. As someone who has once felt addicted to social media, specifically after the pandemic, I felt this is such a relevant, important topic for young people who are living in a technological era.
