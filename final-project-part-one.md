# Part I: Final Project Outline 

## Proposal 
This analysis will be an exploration of how social media usage affects the mental health and wellbeing of young adults. This study will focus on people ages 16 to 29. There has been extensive research into how social media contributes to sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression. 

Scrolling has become a common, everyday activity among young adults. The data within this presentation will tell a truthful story by exposing how social media negatively influences the lives of young people. After the data is presented, there will be a call to action that encourages young adults to regulate their use on social media. 

### Working Titles: 
The Effects of Social Media on the Mental Health & Well Being of Young People
How Young Adults are Negatively Affected by Social Media 
The Negative Effects of Social Media on Young People’s Mental Health & Well Being

The introduction of the analysis will discuss how often young people use social media. The climax will make the claim that social media negatively affects young people and will reveal how it does. The resolution will be a call to action that will provide resources on how young adults can limit their social media usage and how effective these better practices are in reducing the negative effects. 

## Audience Perspective 
Social media is heavily utilized for a variety of purposes such as marketing, connecting with friends, and even as a source of news. The audience may be intrigued by the concept of social media having a negative influence on young people, since it’s widely perceived that this demographic makes up social media’s most active users. Moreover, the audience may be interested in how they can be more aware of better practices to avoid doomscrolling or chronic social media usage. 

“As a reader, I want to understand how social media may be affecting me in ways I was unaware of and how I can protect myself from negative effects.”  

“I can do this by deleting social media, limiting my time scrolling, or making my phone “dumb” and observing how being off social media for a few days makes me feel.”

## Method & Medium 
A combination of Tableau, DataWrapper, Shorthand, and hand drawn sketches will be utilized for the creation of this presentation’s data visualizations. The usage of each will depend on how the data should be conveyed and which method allows for more efficiency in designing certain visualizations. The data that has been collected so far is very straightforward, so this may contribute to a simple design process.
This analysis will be available on this Github page. 

The critique methods that will be used within the design process will be from the Good Charts reading as well as Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness profile. These methods will both play a large role as I develop my visualizations as each gives me a strong idea of how my designs can be informative, emotive, and comprehensive. Through the process of creating my drafts, I will reference these tools. 

## Current Data Sources

These data sources really dive into the various elements the story will cover. It also includes lots of data that informs the audience how much young people are on social media, how social media affects them, and suggestions for good practices for reducing usage. Overall, the data below will be visualized in such a way it enhances the story while moving it forward. 

The data I will include and visualize is listed below. Notably, many of the sources did not provide visualizations of this data. I also mention where within the story the data will be presented. Please note that the list below is very broad and as the story is developed, it will be narrowed down accordingly. Data will also be collected among students in Heinz College through a survey that asks the frequency in which students find themselves on social media and how they feel after doing this.
