# Critique and Redesign

## Step One: The Visualization

### The Original Data Visualization: 
["One in Four Americans Say It's Wrong to Eat an Octopus"].(
https://www.statista.com/chart/30299/us-survey-on-ethics-of-eating-animals/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0b3kDXFFgja77GuHhVjBJzS6KkEphRhH2qa33HXDBk_lhYB56)

The original data visualization compares how many people in the U.S. think it's wrong to eat an octopus versus other animals. I selected this data visualization because the article’s title, along with its information, had quickly intrigued me as it explained how people commonly perceive the morality of eating various animals. In other words, the story resonated with me. The data visualization itself, the only one attached to the article, failed to capture the entire essence of the article. Overall, I chose this data visualization because given what the article described, I wanted to tell a more effective story that really attacked the idea that it’s okay to eat an octopus. 

## Step Two: The Critique

### Critique Process: 
The original data visualization is mostly informative with a perceptible, simple design as a bar graph and an intuitive structure, with the percentages on the top of each bar and the type of animal on the bottom of each bar. The data specifically focuses on how "one in four people think it's wrong to eat an octopus" and while the octopus bar is a slightly darker color than the others, it is not very prominent. The aesthetic was a little weak as the color of the bars were all within the same color family and it took a second to decipher where my eye should be going. 

The completeness of the graph works well as there is a comparison occurring between the levels of the bars referring to the octopus and other animals.The title compliments this, being straight forward in terms of what's happening within the graph. However, if this data visualization was standing on its own without the article to accompany it, the reason why the octopus bar is darker would be unclear. 

The truthfulness of the graph is apparent as everything that is mentioned in the article aligns with the visual and nothing feels disproportionate. The graph is highly informative considering that much of the information brought up in the article is discussing the various animals which are included. However, the graph could utilize more emotive tools to tell a more specific story about the morality of eating an octopus.  

The primary audience for this tool are those who are interested in observing perspectives regarding the morality of eating different types of animals. The article itself (given the title) effectively reaches those who may believe it is immoral to eat an octopus, but also to convince people that eating an octopus is wrong. However, it could emphasize one of the ideas that the article presents, which compares the emotional state of an octopus to a three year old child, to perhaps further differ the octopus from the other animals. Ultimately, the visualization’s story could be more refined. 

### Critique Methods: 
I used Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. This differed from the Good Charts method in the sense that I knew what I was specifically looking for within the data visualization rather than relying on my own impulse. Scaling the components of Few’s recommended attributes of data visualizations was a very insightful process as I recognized how effective each of these attributes were in understanding the data’s story and the audience’s experience. 

### Ideas for Redesign: 
My redesign will focus on emphasizing the bar that references the octopus and dim the other bars that reference other animals through the use of colors. I am excited how the visualization would look if I made the other data gray and the data of the octopus a more eye-grabbing color. I will also play with different structures to see if the information can be conveyed in a more aesthetic and engaging manner.

## Step Three: Sketch a Solution

### Sketch Process: 
My goal for this sketch was to make the data a little more emotive and build on how it is already very informative. While the comparison to the morality perspective of the other animals is valid, the story is really focusing on the octopus. Therefore, I focused on making the point about how "one in four people think it's wrong to eat an octopus" more striking through hue, structure, and size.

## Step Four: Test the Solution

### Interview Process: 

#### Subject 1: Student, Arts Management, Mexico 
Q: Can you please describe what story you think this is telling?
A: This story is really emphasizing that nearly a quarter of people think it's bad to eat an octopus. 

Q: Is there anything you find confusing or misleading? 
A: I am unsure why people think it's bad to eat an octopus. 

Q: Who do you think the intended audience is for this? 
	A: It could be for people who are interested in animals. 

Q: Is there anything you would change or do differently? 
A: I would change the color of the octopus’ bar to be red, giving the data a “bloody” or eerie feeling. There are so many animals listed, maybe the other data doesn’t need much attention if it's primarily focused on the octopus. 

Q: Do you think this type of graph tells this story effectively? 
	A: For the most part, yes. 

Q: Do you feel the title of the graph aligns with the visual? 
A: Yes, but it took a second to understand. The language could be more simple. 

#### Subject 2: Student, Arts Management, United States 
Q: Can you please describe what story you think this is telling?
A: I immediately thought “look at the octopus.” I think this is trying to tell me that eating an octopus is wrong. 

Q: Is there anything you find confusing or misleading? 
A: I was curious if the data was about measuring the morality of eating animals rather than the thoughts of people. I realized it’s more like a debate. 

Q: Who do you think the intended audience is for this? 
A: People who are wary about eating certain foods. 

Q: Is there anything you would change or do differently? 
A: I would add something, maybe like a description or another visual, that shows us how octopus can experience emotions. 

Q: Do you think this type of graph tells this story effectively? 
A: Yes, but I think the story could be better emphasized. 

Q: Do you feel the title of the graph aligns with the visual? 
A: I would change the wording from “immoral” to “wrong” so it’s less about morality. 

### Feedback: 
To summarize the feedback above, I learned that the data visualization I designed still tells a broader story and though there is more focus on the octopus, it's unclear as to why. 

## Step Five: Build the Solution

### Revised Goals: 
My new goal is to condense the data and make the data visualization more emotive by revealing the fact that an octopus can experience negative and positive emotions However, doing this and still comparing the octopus to other animals is tricky, so I will remove certain animals to accommodate for emphasizing this idea. I will also make the color more relative to the emotion that I am trying to convey. Overall, I will revise the visualization by making changes to the structure and colors while adding clear, relevant information. 

### Redesign Process: 

<div style="min-height:355px" id="datawrapper-vis-bsq8k"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bsq8k/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-bsq8k"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bsq8k/full.png" alt="Percentage of U.S. adults who say it is wrong to eat the following animals under normal circumstances (Bar Chart)" /></noscript></div>

I reread the article a few times and noticed there was additional data mentioned in the article that tied directly to the story. Besides the type of animal, the data also included the percentage of people who said they were not comfortable eating animals with specific attributes such as a “capacity of self awareness.” I decided to add this piece of information to my second redesign to provide more context about how octopi are self-aware. 

I kept a similar structure to my redesign.  I took the feedback to change the colors to be more emotive. I decided to incorporate red for the octopus bar and orange for the “any self-aware animal” bar. This was to create a relationship between the bars while having them still emphasized among the other gray bars. 

I also changed the word “immoral” to “wrong” in the title to be more straightforward about the topic at hand, which is that most people still think it's okay to eat an octopus even though it is self-aware. I also realized the purposefulness of the original data visualization because a chimp, dog, and cat are more perceived as being closer to humans than salmon or a chicken. However, an octopus is realistically emotionally close to a human too. Therefore, it was more important to show the data regarding animal self-awareness. 

I learned that incorporating additional data can be really useful to emphasize a point, but data can also be condensed through the use of color. I also recognized that using eye-grabbing colors that are also associated with certain feelings, in this instance I use red for “blood”, can make a graph more emotive. I also learned that keeping it simple is not a bad thing! 

In comparison to the original, I feel the aesthetic improved with the deescalation of the bars and the eye going towards the middle. The graph is still informative and perhaps even more now so with the additional context. Overall, I feel this redesign has improved the emotive aspects and enhanced the informative aspects of the original data visualization.
